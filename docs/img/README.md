# Flows Definitions and Images
Flow-type images used in the documentation  are generated via MermaidJS.

## Schemas
The YAML-based schemas that define each flow are located in the `./graph` directory and any flow can be updated via their online editor at # https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor.

## Styles
Styles are defined via JSON. The following settings were used during image generation.

```json
{
  "theme": "dark",
  "themeVariables": {
    "primaryColor": "#ff9900",
    "secondaryColor": "#ffcc00",
    "tertiaryColor": "#2b908f",
    "primaryTextColor": "#ffffff",
    "secondaryTextColor": "#eeeeee",
    "lineColor": "#d3d3d3",
    "errorTextColor": "#ffffff",
    "errorBackgroundColor": "#ff3f3f"
  }
}
```
