# HotMesh
The *MeshCall* and *MemFlow* modules are all created using the HotMesh modeling system. Refer to the following documents to better understand the platform and how it delivers workflow orchestration using decentralized message routers. 

## FAQ
Refer to the [FAQ](./faq.md) for terminology, definitions, and an exploration of how HotMesh facilitates orchestration use cases.

## Quick Start
Refer to the [Quick Start](./quickstart.md) for sample YAML workflows you can copy, paste, and modify to get started with HotMesh.

## Developer Guide
For more details on the complete development process, including information about schemas, APIs, and deployment, consult the [Developer Guide](./developer_guide.md).

## Model Driven Development
[Model Driven Development](./model_driven_development.md) is an established strategy for managing process-oriented tasks. Check out this guide to understand its foundational principles.

## Data Mapping
Exchanging data between activities is central to HotMesh. For detailed information on supported functions and the functional mapping syntax (@pipes), see the [Data Mapping Overview](./data_mapping.md).

## Composition
While the simplest graphs are linear, detailing a consistent sequence of non-cyclical activities, graphs can be layered to represent intricate business scenarios. Some can even be designed to accommodate long-lasting workflows that span months. For more details, check out the [Composable Workflow Guide](./composable_workflow.md).

## System Lifecycle
Gain insight into HotMesh's monitoring, exception handling, and alarm configurations via the [System Lifecycle Guide](./system_lifecycle.md).

## Distributed Orchestration | System Overview
HotMesh is a distributed orchestration engine. Refer to the [Distributed Orchestration Guide](./distributed_orchestration.md) for a high-level overview of the approach.

## Distributed Orchestration | System Design
HotMesh is more than Redis and TypeScript. The theory that underlies the architecture is applicable to any number of data storage and streaming backends: [A Message-Oriented Approach to Decentralized Process Orchestration](https://zenodo.org/records/12168558).
