/**
 * The MemFlow service is a collection of services that
 * emulate Temporal's capabilities, but instead are
 * backed by Postgres or Redis/ValKey. The following lifecycle example
 * demonstrates how to start a new workflow, subscribe
 * to the result, and shutdown the system.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import { Client, Worker, MemFlow, HotMesh } from '@hotmeshio/hotmesh';
 * import { Client as Postgres} from 'pg';
 * import * as workflows from './workflows';
 *
 * //1) Initialize the worker
 * await Worker.create({
 *   connection: {
 *     class: Postgres,
 *     options: {
 *       connectionString: 'postgresql://usr:pwd@localhost:5432/db',
 *     }
 *   }
 *   taskQueue: 'default',
 *   namespace: 'memflow',
 *   workflow: workflows.example,
 *   options: {
 *     backoffCoefficient: 2,
 *     maximumAttempts: 1_000,
 *     maximumInterval: '5 seconds'
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * //2) initialize the client
 * const client = new Client({
 *   connection: {
 *     class: Postgres,
 *     options: {
 *       connectionString: 'postgresql://usr:pwd@localhost:5432/db',
 *     }
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * //3) start a new workflow
 * const handle = await client.workflow.start({
 *   args: ['HotMesh', 'es'],
 *   taskQueue: 'default',
 *   workflowName: 'example',
 *   workflowId: HotMesh.guid(),
 *   namespace: 'memflow',
 * });
 *
 * //4) subscribe to the eventual result
 * console.log('\nRESPONSE', await handle.result(), '\n');
 * //logs 'Â¡Hola, HotMesh!'
 *
 * //5) Shutdown (typically on sigint)
 * await MemFlow.shutdown();
 * ```
